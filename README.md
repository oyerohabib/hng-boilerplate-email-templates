## ðŸ¤” How Does It Work?

These templates are part of the general email functionality for the application. The email service, developed on the backend, can be used by various parts of the application such as signing in, signing up, password recovery, account deactivation, invoice generation, etc.

Templates are uploaded through an endpoint and stored on the backend. The backend developer can reference these templates by name. Additionally, the templates include dynamic fields like `{{name}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{token}}`, `{{link}}`, which are populated with values passed from the backend.
